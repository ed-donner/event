# How to play Alliance

First visit [CodeSpaces Settings in Github](https://github.com/settings/codespaces) and add in new keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxx
ALLIANCE_MCP_SERVER=xxx
```

Then launch this CodeSpace:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/ed-donner/event?quickstart=1)

In the codespace, wait a few minutes for your codespace to initialize. When you see that the `.venv` directory has been created, you can run:

`uv run simple.py`

To launch your simple player and investigate the rules!
